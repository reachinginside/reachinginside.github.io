I'm not an expert on identifying codependency, especially not my own.  However I am getting better at identifying it in others.  

I now attend a Codependents Anonymous group - I'm a six-month veteran.  On Friday evenings, I can practice patiently listening to others (boy do I need it), and I can practice sharing openly with people.  And everyone is committed to following some group rules. 

Some weeks I make headway, I make improvements or I gain insight; some weeks it's like I'm starting over and simply a time I dedicate to remembering that I'm a codependent.

Because of of this new perspective about my interactions with others, I now see this behaviour everywhere I go. I try to avoid being contemptous of *those* who still behave this way, but with a little bit of knowledge and a missing a touch of humility, its easy to mistakenly see others flaws and not ones' own.

That's not to say that it's easy for me to not be a dick, and yes I'm fully aware - I once admitted with pride and irony both, when a friend asked how a recent book club meeting went: "It was good.  I won".  

I'm getting better overall, but I do notice when others are letting their codependency show.  And as often as not, it's in other support groups.

While my Dharma class is not strictly a "support" group, I figure anyone who is motivated to learn the Dharma is coming from a place of suffering, as in the First Noble Truth.   So I tend to think that if you have an understanding of your suffering and you want to changee then you are **in recovery** of some sorts - even if you don't have a name for your condition yet.

We have a small group in our Saturday night class and I've been there such a short time that there are regulars that I have not yet met.  I met Barb this past weekend.

During the question period she asked about anger:  "Does Buddhism allow for any type of positive anger? For example, in the case of trying to defend yourself, where it can be justified."

It did not take too much imagination to sense that she was asking her question from a very personal place.

The monk answered in a light manner, not too heavy and serious.  Barb did not seem happy with the response that "Anger was unhealthy from a karmic perspective - in all cases".

Things got interesting at this point.

Yichuan tried to help, to clarify Barb's question and add context to help the monk have a better context of the question, "where Barb was coming from".  She asked her question by elaborating on points that she thought would help; and yet ended up with a question that Barb did not want to ask, slowly shaking her head in disapproval.  The monk took more time answering now, sensing the frustration.

Unfortunately, Glenn an old hippie in the group, started getting excited, nodding emphatically to the monk's answers.  After which, Glenn proceeded to talk *directly* to Barb - and not even ask a question of the monk.  Now it was pissing me off!  I had to spend most of my energy now not getting too angry at this disrepectful conduct.  Fucking Whities!  The arrogance we have.  It was all I could do to stop myself from telling him to shut the fuck up.  I kept quiet, and if I do end up saying something to him eventually, it will likely be a pointed request to not ever answer a question that I direct to the monk.

The *conversation* continued until after the question period, where everyone was trying to explain things to Barb and it just ended up like a debate where 3 people kept on the topic and Barb ended up feeling like she was defending her position in a debate.  I finally spoke up as we were ending things and asked her how she felt about everyone hijacking her conversation and trying to *teach* her.  She admitted she was getting pissed off at the entire group.  I thanked her for sharing and a few people got the message and reflected on the mistakes they were making by not just listening to Barb.

Now I don't think that this is obvious codependent behavior.  However I have learned more these months about proper and respectful conduct in support groups and very useful communication practices in my CoDA group.  It is important to have, and to offer, a safe space to share.  When you are sharing, working out how you feel about something and questioning things out of a genuine desire to heal and get better, it really doesn't help to have a fellow group member answer in a manner that you feel you are being lectured to.

>  ... to love another means to fully understand his or her suffering.

In these groups that I attend I focus solely on listening.  I don't like everyone at the groups, but if I am judging someone I note my busy mind and just try and listen with compassion.  I'm thankful for these opportunities to practice listening.  It does take practice, and we can all get better at it.
