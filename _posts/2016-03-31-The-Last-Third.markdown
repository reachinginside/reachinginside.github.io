Most days I am not certain how old I am.  I just don't remember, or more accurately, don't care to remember.  It's a number that doesn't mean much to me.  However I've been thinking more of it lately; I'm entering what I think of as the last third of my life.

Now I'm not basing this purely on numbers but if I was told today I was going to live until I was 75 then I'd be ok with that.  When would I prefer to die?  I can't answer that so 75 it is.

Dividing up, labelling and otherwise using arbitrary perspectives are not typically of interest to me.  But recent events have tempted me to consider my life differently.  And while I understand that this black and white thinking is not helpful for me, I do it nonetheless because I want to communicate the change I'm undergoing.

First, my life up to today - named for convenience:
  Ignorance
  Ignorance and flailing
  Ignorance, flailing and parenting

What's next?  Well I'm believe I'm  in the phase of Ignorance, flailing, parenting and recovery now.  Some of my group members use the term In Recovery but I would rather think of me being At Recovery, as if it's a place I've visiting but passing through.  So I really have to live here?

Instead of fixating on the "one truly serious philosophical problem", according to Camus, I now see my future through Buddhist coloured lenses.  Maybe that's not adequately describing the change; I'm not just passively wearing new glasses.  But I am seeing everything very differently, including my future.

The event is a course I attended in which I may have have learned how to live.  It's a meditation style that gives me more balance moment to moment than I've ever had and it also requires a commitment to practice.  A level of commitment that I have never applied to anything else.  And yet it meets all rational reflections regarding whether it is “worth it” or not.  And further to that I see that it's a practice that I can get better at and I ask myself sometimes “why did I find this so late?”.  Thus my reflections on how much time I may have left.  In a truly Buddhist sense I may gain some improvements regarding my mind, and yet all I can hope for is the positive and opportunistic rebirth to continue this journey.  I don't really know yet of what I speak but these are my ruminations that lead to considering the next third of my life, the last third of my life.  It could be worse – I could be living a year ago and reflecting on when I should "Consider Camus".
