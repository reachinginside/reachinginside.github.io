When I try and look back on my life I sometimes scan photos and snapshots.  But there are gaps.  Events that have no record and my memory has no index either.

I ask myself why I don't have the instinct/habit to snap them.

I wonder if it didn't occur to me because I don't typically look back.   It's difficult to make a record; pictures just make me sad.
