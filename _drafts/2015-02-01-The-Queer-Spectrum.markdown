The first time I heard that phrase, or at least really listened to that phrase, Q and I were driving.  We were going to his morning therapy session and I asked him how his notions of changing gender would affect his relationship.  Q is approaching two years in a relationship with a girl.  Best friends, lovers, confidantes - why change it.  What needs to change?  I had asked what his peers at school think of his gender dysphoria when he's been in a hetero relationship for almost 2 years.  Isn't that like 10 years in adult years?

He said everyone at his school is somewhere on the queer spectrum.  And his girlfriend, is now on the spectrum by defacto, relative placement.  And it's a spectrum; not black and white polk-a-dots, nor paint swatches.  No two colors are exactly the same on this spectrum.

I'm starting to think that by understanding, nay really trying to understand him, well at least trying to accept this all, that I'm now on the spectrum as well.
