The first time I heard that phrase, or at least really listened to that phrase, Q and I were driving.  We were going to his/her morning therapy session and I asked him/her how his/her notions of changing his/her gender from male to female would affect his/her relationship.  

Q is approaching two years in a relationship with a born female.  Best friends, lovers, confidantes - why change it.  What needs to change?  I had asked what his peers at school think of his/her gender dysphoria when he/she has been in a binary conforming relationship for almost 2 years.  

Two teenage years - isn't that like 10 adult years?

He/she said everyone at his/her school is somewhere on the queer spectrum.  His/her girlfriend also has by now her own "named" place on the spectrum.   And even if she wasn't marking her own place on the spectrum, she is still there by being with Q.  She's with him/her so she's on the spectrum.  

And it is a spectrum: one made of similar but not identical colors.  In the LGBTQ community it appears there are no two places occupied by the same color, the same identity.

I'm starting to think that by thinking about the gender spectrum, by really practicing tolerance, by attempting to accept how others chose to communicate their gender identity, that I'm now on the spectrum as well.
