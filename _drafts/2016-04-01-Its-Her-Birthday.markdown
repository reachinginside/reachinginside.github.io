> ...that to love another means to fully understand his or her suffering...

Sweet 18.

So that's what I've been doing for all these years.

Working too - as support and escape both.

This hasn't turned out as I had expected or hoped.  I figured it would all be easier and less painful.  But then again, apart from thiese characteristics, I really never did have a vision.  I don't wish for things and dream big.  I just thought being a parent would be something to add to my life, not this thing that has forced me to change or die.  But that's Ignorance in my book.

And to be honest, I rather expected my own pain and suffering, and in fact I have been drawn to it.  In a mentally masochistic way I have stuggled with the thoughts that I deserve it.  As a young man when I flirted with writing as a career, nay the "path of meaning" I recognized my ignorance and knew full well that I was going to have to suffer to ever have anything to write about.  I just didn't have any real idea of what suffering was, as well as wisdom or understanding.  

Mental pain has brought me to suffering, and suffering to insight and acceptance.  I really should say I'm been brought to the humble view that I will dedicate myself to the path of attaining insight and acceptence.

Q is 18 and it presents a challenge to acceptence.  Today she turns 18, this year he turns into a she and will the next decade be her transforming into a happy person.

Adulthood - man o man, I have struggled to feel like an adult my entire life and I see she isn't ready herself.  Borderline Personality Disorder, Gender Dysphoria, Depression this is what she's collected to bring with her into 18 and on.  Not that she'll be moving on to far in the near future.  No, the basement is her safe-zone, her prison. 

I all of a sudden not surprised that I woke up before 5 this morning, and couldn't focus at all while I medidated this morning.  I took today off and we'll go shopping for some little gifts.  But I'm a bundle of grief and joy, fear and relief.

This is the reason I go to CODA - over the last few years I have learned how dodependent I am.  It's nothing new, and most people exibit these "normal" tendencies - but we put labels on certain behaviors when it becomes a "problem".  When things get bad enough that you have to give everything a shake to try and identify what we are wearing and thinking that's become so chafing and bothersome.  We identify with the codependent label because our behaviors are causing us suffering and we need to practice changing, and to change one must first understand.  

Understanding is the key.


This beautiful quote is rather a challenge for a codependent.  It's difficult for most people to not try and fix the causes of suffering, as if that's even possible.  Everything causes us suffering.  We have to stop and recalibrate if we are to have a chance of understanding another person's suffering and not become entwined, take it on, let it make us mad, upset or indignant.
