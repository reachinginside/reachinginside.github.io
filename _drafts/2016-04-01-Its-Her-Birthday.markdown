Sweet 18.

April Fools day was both a Birth Day and a Borderline Day.

None of this has turned out like I thought it would.  I just thought it would be easy - I didn't really think about it.  Ever.

Suffering

I figured it would all be easier and less painful.  I'm not a planner - I don't wish for things and dream big.  I guess I just thought being a parent would be something to add to my life: not this continual barage of self-questioning experience that has forced me to change or die.  

And yet I always assumed suffering was in my future.  In a mentally masochistic way I have stuggled with the thoughts that I deserve suffering; I don't deserve to be happy.  

As a young man I had thought I would write.  I admired writers and their books.  And I was drawn to writers who suffered.  I wanted to write something meaningful and concluded that I needed to suffer.  I was a quiet zealot; a fiercely opinionated youth who knew better than everyone else and I rode those grandiose visions through years of driving cab, a marriage and some schooling. 

So I started the career path of suffering.  But it was non-systematic and random.  I thought at times I was clever, and other times, happy.  This was a naive and ignorant view of suffering.

Next steps: I knew I needed a son so I joined forces with another lost soul and we accomplished the deed.  Months after April Fools day 18 years ago I left the partner in crime and have been centering my life around this new child with the notion that I could empart some knowledge and wisdom.  

Mental pain has brought me to suffering, and suffering to a wish for insight and acceptance. 

Q is 18 and it presents a challenge to acceptence.  Today she turns 18, this year he turns into a she and will the next decade be her transforming into a happy person.

Adulthood - man o man, I have struggled to feel like an adult my entire life and I see she isn't ready herself.  Borderline Personality Disorder, Gender Dysphoria, Depression this is what she's collected to bring with her into adult years.  Not that she'll be moving on to far in the near future.  No, the basement is her safe-zone, her prison. 

No surprise that I woke up before 5 this morning, and couldn't focus at all while I medidated this morning.  I took today off and we'll go shopping for some little gifts.  But I'm a bundle of grief and joy, fear and relief.

This is the reason I go to CODA - over the last few years I have learned how dodependent I am.  It's nothing new, and most people exibit these "normal" tendencies - but we put labels on certain behaviors when it becomes a "problem".  When things get bad enough that you have to give everything a shake to try and identify what we are wearing and thinking that's become so chafing and bothersome.  We identify with the codependent label because our behaviors are causing us suffering and we need to practice changing, and to change one must first understand.
