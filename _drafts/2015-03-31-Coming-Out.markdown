Q came out.

With his head down, and focusing entirely on his Lego on the floor in front of him, he said "Dad, I need to tell you something.  I'm gender dysphoric.  I identify as a woman."

Sometimes in life, when you aren't the first, you can easily feel like the last person being told the news.  Sure, there are people who don't know at all, but the inner circle of a teenager extends far outside the house and family.  It's watching growth and independence and confusion and insecurity within a frame of reference that shifts and floats in and out of focus.  And that's just for me.

Maybe years in development, maybe months in anticipation for Q; and I can't even remember the moment clearly.  Perhaps it was a day after my memory tells me, or even a day after that when I remembered Q telling me.  A photograph would be nice, or perhaps a journal entry expressing everything I saw and everything I felt at that moment.  But no one wrote that for me, it didn't occur to anyone to take a snapshot.  It didn't occur to me because I don't typically look back.   It's difficult to make a record; pictures just make me sad.

All I do know was that by the time Q told me he was already on medication for anxiety and depression.  So as we left the house to go shopping I told him that when he grows up I just want him to be happy and to have some goals to work towards.  The dysphoria itself isn't officially on the list of worries I have, it's just a marker, a placeholder, for knowing that things just got even more difficult and more complicated.
