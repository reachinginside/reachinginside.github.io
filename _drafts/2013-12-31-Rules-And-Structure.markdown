* Don't digress.  If you are tempted to digress, for background, create another separate blog post

> There are four secrets to being a good blog writer:

> 1. Read a lot of other blogs
> 2. Always have a list of potential topics at-hand. For new blogs, I recommend writing 50 sample headlines before you write one post. This will help you better understand what your blog and editorial voice are REALLY all about.
> 3. Don't overwrite. This post notwithstanding, shorter is better, and spending a bunch of extra time to create the "perfect" blog post is almost never worth it.
> 4. Be a great headline writer. It's all a potential reader has to go on to decide whether to click and read (usually).
