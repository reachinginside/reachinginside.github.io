The event is a course I attended in which I may have have learned how to live.  It's a meditation style that gives me more balance moment to moment than I've ever had and it also requires a commitment to practice.  A level of commitment that I have never applied to anything else.  And yet it meets all rational reflections regarding whether it is "worth it" or not.  And further to that I see that it's a practice that I can get better at and I ask myself sometimes "why did I find this so late?".  Thus my reflections on how much time I may have left.  In a truly Buddhist sense I may gain some improvements regarding my mind, and yet all I can hope for is the positive and opportunistic rebirth to continue this journey.
