Most days I am not certain how old I am.  I never think about it.  I just don't remember, or more accurately, don't care to remember.  It's a number that doesn't mean much to me.  

However I've been thinking more of it lately; I'm entering what I think of as the last third of my life.

Now I'm not basing this notion of thirds purely on numbers but then again, if I was told today I was going to live until I was 75 then I'd be ok with that.  I mean, when would I prefer to die?  I can't answer - that so 75 it is.

Now I don't make New Years Resolutions, and I don't measure my life against what I should have, nor what I thought should happen.  But recent events have tempted me to consider my life differently.  And I just hope to explain the change.

First, let me describve my life up to today - periods named for convenience:
*  Ignorance
*  Ignorance and flailing
*  Ignorance, flailing and parenting

What's next?  Well I'm believe I'm  in the phase of **Ignorance, flailing, parenting and recovery** now.  Some of my group members use the term **In Recovery** but I am not really as committed as they are.  Not yet.  Maybe I'm at recovery, visiting, maybe passing through.  Just testing the waters.

The event I spoke of is a course I attended early March.  It's changed everything for me.  It's a meditation style that gives me more balance moment to moment than I've ever had; and it also requires a commitment to practice - a serious committment.  A level of commitment that I have never applied to anything else.  And yet it meets all rational reflections regarding whether it is “worth it” or not.  And further to that I see that it's a practice that I can get better at and I ask myself sometimes “why did I find this so late?”.  

Thus my reflections on how much time I may have left.  

In a truly Buddhist sense I may gain some improvements regarding my mind, and yet all I can hope for is the positive and opportunistic rebirth to continue this journey.  I don't really know yet of what I speak but these are my ruminations that lead to considering the next third of my life, the last third of my life.  It could be worse – I could be living a year ago and reflecting on when I should "Consider Camus".
