I'm sick.  It must be a form of hypocondria, but not focused on being sick, more a focus on mental illness symptoms.  Whenever I research various diagnosis for Q, I end up evaluating myself first.  And everything I research ends up describing me.  I understand that it's all a matter of degree and just because I can relate doesn't mean I have a problem.  Right?

Here are the 9 categories of a BPD Diagnosis:
* strong reactions to fear of abandonment, whether real or imagined
* a history of troubled relationships with extremes in behavior and attitude
* poor sense of self
* impulsive and self-destructive behavior by at least two means (for example, substance abuse, self-mutilation, eating disorder)
* repeated suicidal tendencies
* intense and frequent moodiness and irratibility
* an ongoing sense of emptiness
* intense and uncrontrollable anger
* persistent feelings of detachment
