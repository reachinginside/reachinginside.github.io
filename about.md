My name is not Reaching Inside.  In fact, this is an anonomous blog in the spirit of Anonymous groups.

I currently attend CoDA groups on Fridays.  Being in recovery of sorts I am progessing to the state of more systematic sharing and this blog is going to be a mechanism for my internal work.

This is in the spirit of Recovery Blogs and that of sharing with group members in an anonymous manner.
